## How to use a Jupyter notebook

A Jupyter notebook is composed of different types of cells and their outputs. It is a front-end interface to a back-end kernel. This wiki page is intended to give a brief overview of how to use a notebook.

### Running a cell

When you open a new Jupyter notebook (or a notebook where the outputs have been cleared), each code cell will have a pair of empty square brackets in front of it.

Running a cell executes the code (or renders the Markdown) in the cell. There a three different ways you can run a cell.

Option 1: the "play" button. With your desired cell selected, click the button with a right-pointing triangle in it located in the toolbar at the top of the interface.

Option 2: the menu bar. With your desired cell selected, click the "Run" menu and then click the "Run cell" option.

Option 3: keyboard controls. With your desired cell selected, press the key combination Shift + Enter.

Note: once a code cell has been run, the square brackets in front of it contain a number. This number reports the order in which the cells are run. This number does not appear for Markdown cells because those cells render the formatted text rather than running code.
