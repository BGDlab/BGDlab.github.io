The [Brain-Gene-Development Lab](www.bgdlab.org) is part of both Penn and CHOP, so people affiliated with either institution can join. At Penn, we are part of the [Neurodevelopment and Psychosis Section](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/). At CHOP, we are part of the [Lifespan Brain Institute (LiBI)](https://www.research.chop.edu/libi/). Thankfully, LiBI and the Section are led by the same faculty, so this is not as confusing as it sounds! We recommend that new lab members complete onboarding at both Penn and CHOP, though in some instances this may not be necessary. The basic process is:

1. Have Aaron add you to lab Slack https://bgdlab.slack.com

2. Send an email to the following group of administrators/generally-helpful-people. They can be busy so just email them again after a couple of working days and _cc_ Aaron if you don’t hear back.
* Stace Moore [stacem@pennmedicine.upenn.edu](mailto:stacem@pennmedicine.upenn.edu)
* Sherry Wang [shwang2@pennmedicine.upenn.edu](mailto:shwang2@pennmedicine.upenn.edu)
* Kosha Ruperal [kruparel@pennmedicine.upenn.edu](mailto:kruparel@pennmedicine.upenn.edu)
* Nina Laney [laneyn@email.chop.edu](mailto:laneyn@email.chop.edu) 

Here’s a great sample email from a lab member that covered all of the bases. All of this may not be necessary depending on circumstances!
<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:0.8em;">
> Dear Stace, Sherry, Kosha and Nina,
>
> I’m joining the Brain-Gene-Development Lab as a *** and want to complete any necessary onboarding! Currently I am ***. Aaron asked me to include a picture so that Nina can introduce me to the Section and LiBI (see attached) and to ask about the following items related to Penn:
>
> * A Pennkey
> * A Penn ID and Penn card to access Richards
> * A key to open offices in Richards
> * Access to PMACS LPC
> * UPHS VPN access (so that I can access the CUBIC cluster from off campus)
> * Penn email account
> 
>   And related to CHOP:
>
> * An eResearch account so that I can access Respublica and the BGD Lab fileshare (bgdlab_resnas03)
> * CHOP email account
> * VPN and Virtual Desktop and Access
> 
> Thanks so much for your help with all of this!
> 
> Best, ***

3.   Complete required CITI Research Trainings (www.citiprogram.org)
* Affiliate with both CHOP and Penn on the CITI website
* Complete Basic Human Protections Training (either biomedical OR social behavioral focus)
* Complete Good Clinical Practice Training
* Go to [https://trainingwizard.research.chop.edu/](https://trainingwizard.research.chop.edu/) and follow the Training Wizard instructions. This will guide you toward which CHOP research training you need to complete. Optional research training/reading can be found at: [https://sctraining.research.chop.edu/index.php](https://sctraining.research.chop.edu/index.php)

4. Check out some helpful links
* Once you have PennKey access, you can go to [https://wiki.pmacs.upenn.edu/neuropsych/Administrative](https://wiki.pmacs.upenn.edu/neuropsych/Administrative) and get additional information related to onboarding.
* [This wiki](https://bgdlab.github.io/) contains helpful information maintained by lab members
* The [PennLINC wiki ](https://pennlinc.github.io/)contains a lot of information that is also applicable to BGDlab 
* [https://www.bgdlab.org/](https://www.bgdlab.org/) is our public-facing website. Ask Aaron about getting added to “the Team”.

5. Please help to keep this documentation up to date letting us know if something is wrong or if there is other information that would be helpful.
