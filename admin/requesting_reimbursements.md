*Conference reimbursement process*

Preparation: The expense report process will be much easier if you collect all your receipts and credit card statements before you get started.  I believe that for conferences, they won’t reimburse you until after the date of the conference. You have to upload the receipt, proof you were there (like a program booklet or name badge or something), and then proof you paid it. You can take a screenshot of your bank statement, blur out any account info except last 4 digits, and show the amount and date match what’s on the receipt.) Note, you can start populating the report before the conference with any and all receipts, then submit it after the conference

1. Sign in to your OneDrive application on your local computer and sync all of your documentation to an easy to find location. (I put mine in "Admin/Reimbursements/(YYYY-MM conference)").
2. Go to connect.chop.edu and open a Desktop. 
3. In the Desktop, make sure your documentation is synced and available, then open Microsoft Edge and navigate to at.chop.edu. In the menu on the left side of the page, click the "Workday" link.
4. In Workday under the Quick Tasks menu on the right, select "View All Apps" and then select "Expenses" (icon of a hand holding dollar bills)
5. In the expenses page, under the "Actions" menu select "Create Expense Report"
6. Set up the primary info for the report. This includes entering a "Memo", specifying the "Business Purpose", and making any changes to the default filled values. Click the yellow "OK" button at the bottom left of the screen to create the new expense report in the system.
7. The "OK" button should take you to a page with basic expense report info and totals at the top of the page followed by a header with three tabs: "Header", "Attachments", and "Expense Lines". 
8. Adding an expense line: Click "Add". Enter in the cost per unit, the merchant, and the expense item type (dropdown list). Because the internal file sharing structure is confusing, I highly recommend opening the OneDrive directory in a File Explorer window and dragging your documentation files into the webpage. When you have completed the expense line, click the "Save for Later" button.
9. To add more expense lines, click the "Edit Expense Report" button at the bottom left of the page, then click the gold "Add" button under the header tabs. 
10. When all expense lines and documentation has been added, add a per diem. Follow the instructions on the per diem page
11. Finally, you need to submit confirmation that you attended the conference. This confirmation can be as simple as a photo of your name badge. Click "Edit Expense Report" and navigate to the "Attachments" tab. Upload your confirmation and save the report.
12. Address any errors and submit your report!
