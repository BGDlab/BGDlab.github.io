# Getting up and running on [[CUBIC]]

## 1. Get a project

Project request as a ticket. Requires form [[19.01 CUBIC Project Application]], confirmation email from PI that project can be created. The project can be created by submitting a ticket to the [CBICA helpdesk](https://cbica-infr-vweb/rt/SelfService/).

Note: if the user is trying to access [[CUBIC]] from a personal laptop, they will need to submit a ticket to get approval to use the BIG-IP vpn by IS. (Yeah so first I called the IT support desk and they filed a ticket to get my account approved to use BIG-IP by security. I got an email from someone named Kristy Peters in the end who said she set it up -- Ayan) 

## 2. Setting up the project

Highly recommend installing your own conda for the project. Makes managing packages so much easier. Double check with your friendly lab tech support to see if this step has already been taken care of. Instructions

## 3. Add users to the project

Before adding a user to a CUBIC project, the user must have a UPHS or Pennmedicine account as well as VPN access. 

First, the user needs to have their own CUBIC account. This can be done by the data manager (?) or PI of a project via a ticket request. The ticket portal can be found [here](https://cbica-portal.uphs.upenn.edu/rt/SelfService/). The creation of a user account should be straightforward and quick. The only information that is needed is the UPHS username and full name of the user.

Once the user has a CUBIC account, they can be added to the project. This is again done via the ticket portal. The information required to complete the request is the user's username, the full path to the project, and the level of access the user should have (read only or read and write). Additionally, written permission from the PI of the project needs to be attached to the ticket when it is submitted.
