Annotation Guidelines - Arcus

Overall Purpose



* Modify the terms that do not directly indicate the patient has psychotic symptoms
* Adding a modifier is excluding that term from Harshini’s analysis
* There are two ways of curating a dataset of people with confirmed psychosis
    * Clinical interviews are more reliable since these cases are determined by a psychiatrist
    * Using these terms in the notes is less reliable
* Harshini is going through the notes and looking for ways to improve the correlation between these two ways of identification 
    * Ex: exclude negated terms to make the correlation stronger
    * By annotating, you are contributing to this process
