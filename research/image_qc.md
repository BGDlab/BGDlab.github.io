*Structural Image QC*

These guidelines were last updated 2022-11-07.

## Overview

The purpose of this QC step is to have as many people as possible look at structural brain MRIs and provide an informed but quickly formed opinion about the quality of a scan. To prevent overwhelm as well as combat any sort of grading order bias, the images have been randomly divided into batches stratified by age group (neonatal/infant brains look different from older kid brains). Each batch is designed to take about 30 minutes to fully grade.

Details:
- For each scan, 3 slices (pseudorandomly chosen at approximately the 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% slices) will be displayed for a single view (saggittal, axial, or coronal). 
- All 9 slices for a single scan are contained in the same batch.
- All images in a batch MUST be graded in the same sitting.
- Every grader will grade every batch, but the batch order and the order in which the images are displayed are both randomized.
- All of the grades will be averaged to get a final QC score.

## Grading criteria 

The grading follows a 0/1/2/-1 system with each rating having the following meaning:
- 0: poor quality, ringing, high degree of motion
- 1: not sure/maybe usable
- 2: good quality
- -1: a flag indicating “heck don't include this scan but not for quality reasons” images. Think scans that aren’t of the brain, are post contrast (bright CSF), or are magically not MRI.

Things to consider when looking at an image:
- Tissue contrast: is the "edge" between gray matter and white matter clear? Are the cortical folds distinct?
- Movement artifacts: is the image blurry? Does it look like two (or more) images with the brain in slightly different positions are being displayed on top of each other?
- Ringing: does it look like someone dropped a pebble into a pool of water? 

## Important note: age based lack of tissue differentiation

There is a phenomenon that occurs in T1 weighted images of infants. In particularly young patients, the brightness of white and grey matter is flipped. Starting around 6 months of age (~180 days), the tissue properties begin to change with the end result that gray matter shows up gray in T1w images and white matter shows up white in T1 weighted images. In the manual QC, difficulties identifying gray and white tissue due to this phenomenon are referred to as “age based lack of tissue differentiation” and are labeled as 1.
