*Structural Image QC*


- For each structural image to be examined, 9 slices have been pseudorandomly chosen: 3 from each view (axial, saggital, and coronal) at approximately the 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% slices.
- The sets of slices have been divided into batches. All 9 pngs for each scan are in the same batch. Each batch is can be graded in arount 30 minutes. (Are there too many or too few pngs in each batch? How long did it take for you to go through each batch?)
- The grading follows a 0/1/2/-1 system with each rating having the following meaning:
    - 0: poor quality, ringing, high degree of motion
    - 1: not sure/maybe usable
    - 2: good quality
    - -1: a flag for “heck don't include this scan but not for quality reasons” images. Think scans that aren’t of the brain, are post contrast, or are magically not MRI.
